# Loan Approval Analysis: The loan approval dataset is a compilation of financial records and related 
data used to assess the eligibility of individuals or organizations seeking loans from a lending 
institution. It includes information such as applicants' income, credit scores (CIBIL scores), the 
amount of loan requested, loan terms, the value of assets, educational background, and the final loan 
status (approved, rejected, etc.). Presented below are the findings derived from the comprehensive 
analysis I have conducted.
