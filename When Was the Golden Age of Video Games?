Let's find the ten best-selling video games in game_sales.

SELECT *
FROM game_sales
ORDER BY games_sold DESC
LIMIT 10;


Let's determine how many games in the game_sales table are missing both a user_score and a critic_score.

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM game_sales AS g
LEFT JOIN reviews AS r
ON g.game = r.game
WHERE critic_score IS NULL 
    AND user_score IS NULL;


Find the years with the highest average critic_score.

SELECT 
    year, 
    ROUND(AVG(critic_score),2) AS avg_critic_score
FROM game_sales AS g
INNER JOIN reviews AS r
ON g.game = r.game
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY avg_critic_score DESC
LIMIT 10;


Find game critics' ten favorite years, this time with the stipulation that a year must have more than four games released in order to be considered.

SELECT 
    year, 
    COUNT(*) AS num_games, 
    ROUND(AVG(critic_score),2) AS avg_critic_score
FROM game_sales AS g
INNER JOIN reviews AS r
ON g.game = r.game
GROUP BY year
HAVING COUNT(*) > 4
ORDER BY avg_critic_score DESC
LIMIT 10;


Use set theory to find the years that were on our first critics' favorite list but not the second.

SELECT 
    year, 
    avg_critic_score
FROM top_critic_years
EXCEPT 
SELECT year, avg_critic_score
FROM top_critic_years_more_than_four_games
ORDER BY avg_critic_score DESC;


Update your query from Task Four so that it returns years with ten highest avg_user_score values.

SELECT 
    year, 
    ROUND(AVG(user_score),2) AS avg_user_score, 
    COUNT(*) AS num_games
FROM game_sales AS g
INNER JOIN reviews AS r
ON g.game = r.game
GROUP BY year
HAVING COUNT(*) > 4
ORDER BY avg_user_score DESC
LIMIT 10;


Create a list of years that appear on both the top_critic_years_more_than_four_games table and the top_user_years_more_than_four_games table.

SELECT year 
FROM top_critic_years_more_than_four_games
INTERSECT
SELECT year
FROM top_user_years_more_than_four_games;


Add a column showing total games_sold in each year to the table you created in the previous task.

SELECT 
    year, 
    SUM(games_sold) AS total_games_sold
FROM game_sales
WHERE year IN (SELECT year 
FROM top_critic_years_more_than_four_games
INTERSECT
SELECT year
FROM top_user_years_more_than_four_games)
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY total_games_sold DESC;
